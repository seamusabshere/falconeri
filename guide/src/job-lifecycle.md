## Status Transitions

### Job Status

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|-----|---------|
| *(created)* | `Running` | Job inserted into database |
| `Running` | `Done` | All datums succeed |
| `Running` | `Error` | Any datum fails permanently (exhausted retries) |
| `Running` | `Error` | Kubernetes reports a terminal `Failed` condition |
| `Running` | `Error` | Babysitter detects K8s job vanished (after 15min) |

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    [*] --> Running: created
    Running --> Done: all datums succeed
    Running --> Error: datum fails permanently
    Running --> Error: K8s job reports Failed
    Running --> Error: K8s job vanished
```

### Datum Status

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|-----|---------|
| *(created)* | `Ready` | Datum inserted into database |
| `Ready` | `Running` | Worker reserves datum via POST /jobs/{id}/reserve_next_datum |
| `Running` | `Done` | Worker reports success via PATCH /datums/{id} |
| `Running` | `Error` | Worker reports failure via PATCH /datums/{id} |
| `Running` | `Error` | Babysitter detects worker pod vanished |
| `Error` | `Ready` | Babysitter re-queues datum for retry (if retries remain) |

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    [*] --> Ready: created
    Ready --> Running: worker reserves
    Running --> Done: success
    Running --> Error: failure
    Running --> Error: pod vanished
    Error --> Ready: retry (if allowed)
```

### Output File Status

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|-----|---------|
| *(created)* | `Running` | Output file registered via POST /datums/{id}/output_files |
| `Running` | `Done` | Upload succeeds, reported via PATCH /datums/{id}/output_files |
| `Running` | `Error` | Upload fails, reported via PATCH /datums/{id}/output_files |

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    [*] --> Running: registered
    Running --> Done: upload succeeds
    Running --> Error: upload fails
```

## REST API Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/jobs` | POST | Create a new job from pipeline spec |
| `/jobs/{id}` | GET | Get job by ID |
| `/jobs/{id}/reserve_next_datum` | POST | Reserve next available datum (worker) |
| `/datums/{id}` | PATCH | Update datum status (worker) |
| `/datums/{id}/output_files` | POST | Register output files before upload (worker) |
| `/datums/{id}/output_files` | PATCH | Update output file status after upload (worker) |

## Error Handling

### When a datum fails with a normal error:

1. The worker catches the error and calls `PATCH /datums/{id}` with `status: error`
2. The server stores the error message and backtrace
3. The babysitter periodically checks for failed datums with remaining retries
4. Eligible datums are reset to `Ready` status for another attempt
5. Only after exhausting all retries does the datum remain in `Error` status
6. When the last datum finishes (success or permanent failure), the job status is updated

### When a Kubernetes job vanishes mysteriously:

1. The babysitter periodically lists all Kubernetes batch jobs
2. For each running job older than 15 minutes, it checks if a corresponding K8s job exists
3. If the K8s job is missing (deleted manually, TTL expired, etc.), the job is marked as `Error`
4. This prevents jobs from being stuck in `Running` state indefinitely

### When Kubernetes marks a job as failed:

1. The babysitter reads the Kubernetes Job's terminal `Failed` condition
2. It records the Kubernetes reason and message in `job.error_message`
3. It marks the Falconeri job as `Error`
4. Datum retries stop because they only run while the Falconeri job remains `Running`

Kubernetes reaches this condition in two ways: the worker pod failure budget runs out, or the job exceeds its `job_timeout`. Both limits are separate from `datum_tries`, which applies to each datum rather than to the job as a whole. A vanished pod can consume one counted pod failure and one attempt for the datum it had reserved. See [the specification](./specification.md) for how the budget is set.

### When a datum's worker pod vanishes mysteriously:

1. The babysitter periodically lists all running Kubernetes pods
2. For each datum with `status: Running`, it checks if `pod_name` matches a running pod
3. If the pod no longer exists (OOM killed, node failure, eviction, etc.), the datum is marked as `Error`
4. If retries remain, the datum will be re-queued to `Ready` by the retry mechanism
5. When all datums complete (success or permanent failure), the job status is updated
